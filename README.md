Welcome! 
On this website, I share a personal project that resulted in a short documentary about my professional experience in cultural heritage conservation, 
particularly in the preservation of audiovisual archives.

## Special Thanks 
This project was made possible thanks to the support of my husband, a producer, and my sister, a film director, from whom I learned how to document my professional journey through cinema!

The best thing about this short documentary is that I made it with my filmmaker friends! 
and with the support of their production company Saurio Films, in which I have also participated in their projects.

Working at the Visual and Sound Archive has been one of the most enriching professional experiences, and it was the main filming location for the documentary.
